# Requirements
## Introduction
 * The Bank Management System is an application for maintaining multiple person's account in a bank. In this project I tried to show the working of a banking account system and cover the basic functionality of a Bank Account Management System
 * This topic was chosen because it gives me an opportunity to implement efficient data structures and provides me flexibilty to understand multiple C programming concepts.



### Benefits
Patient management information systems offer a range of benefits to providers big and small. Here are 
just a few of them:

### Better Vaccine Management
A patient management app helps streamline every element of a medical office including recordkeeping, charting, patient scheduling, claims processing and billing functions.

### Ease burden on staff
Administrative staffing is one of the big drivers of high healthcare costs. Automating routine processes like patient flow management helps medical clinics and hospitals minimize their administrative expenses.

### Timely Patient Care
Larger clinics and hospitals can enjoy similar benefits to smaller ones but have the added bonus of making patient-related processes more efficient. Because large practices have a heavy patient flow, the scheduling features of MPM is crucial to operations. Having an organized patient intake flow can mean the difference between a calm, orderly waiting room and a packed hotbed of irritation and frustration.

### Organization
Practice management software offers charting modules to keep patient data, charts, appointments and billing information together in a single digital file. Digital storage capability saves space for a neater, more welcoming office â€” not to mention less harried employees.
